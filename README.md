# Cardgame

Object library for simulating playing cards and games.

## Deck Standards

Default decks are included based on the "Playing Cards" Unicode block, including four French suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs) and fourteen ranks (Ace through Ten plus Jack, Cavalier, Queen, and King). Card backs take the place of the "0th" suit, and Jokers are found where the fifteenth suit would be located. The Deck and Card objects may be inherited to override these values for fully customized decks of cards.
